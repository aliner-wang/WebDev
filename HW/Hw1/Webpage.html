	<h2> Helping with 61c </h2>
	<p> HELLO WDB fellows reading this hw. Here's a story about the time I am writing this hw while simultaneously helping three fellows with their 61c proj. Once upon a time, a berk bear started her cs hw 1 hr before it were due. one friend asked for help on 61c. SO she said yes in hopes to see, the success in their project that she could collect. Soon followed suite, other bears, climbing the stairs with the hope of finishing before going fishing. And soon behold it was a quarter past eleven. How have you been? I ask my friend Jen. Well she says... I just gotta free this malloc and maybe this calloc. And hope for the best when I finish the rest. </p>
